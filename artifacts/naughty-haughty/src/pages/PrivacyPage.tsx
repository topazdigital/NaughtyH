              <li><strong>For legal compliance:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5. Data Security</h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              We implement industry-standard technical and organisational measures to protect your personal
              information against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures
              include encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS), hashed password storage, and access controls
              that limit who within our organisation can access your data.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-3">
              However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
              secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we
              cannot guarantee absolute security. In the event of a data breach that affects your rights and
              freedoms, we will notify you and the relevant authorities as required by applicable law.

              within 30 days, except where we are required to retain it for legitimate legal or business purposes
              (for example, to resolve disputes, prevent fraud, or comply with legal obligations).
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-3">
              Messages sent to other members may remain visible in those members' inboxes after you delete your
